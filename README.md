# CS675_Project: A survey of Krylov Subspace methods for nonsymmetric linear systems.
Project in CS675 - Computational Linear Algebra


1. The folder 'Krylov_subspace_method' contains implementation of GMRES, BiCG, and IDR(s) methods. 

2. The folder 'PoissonPDE' builds the finite difference scheme for {1D,2D,3D} for Poisson PDE equations with 2 heat sources temperature. The `Laplacian` returns the matrix A corresponds to the lhs of finite difference scheme and matrix b of source terms. 

3. The folder 'Image_Denoising' builds the PDE-constrained equation to denoise the camera-man image (tif).
